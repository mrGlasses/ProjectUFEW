# ProjectUFEW
Project U.F.E.W. or Using Flask Easy Webservice is a standard webservice who connects with MariaDB (or MySQL) easily using Project Amelia Data Access.  


# === HOW TO USE ===

I highly recommend using some linux dist. for it.

- Install Python 3 or higher
- Install Python 3 Mysql Connector
- Install Flask
- Create a directory for the files
- I recommend this link for some questions > [Visual Studio and Flask](code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask) 
- Configure your config.cnf for your database - Don't forget to open the correct ports for it
- `python3 app.py` (if everything is ok, a message will come with local IP and port)

Now it's ready to go, have fun.

(I use and recommend procedural sql use for safety)
<s>I hope you know what a webservice is</s>
