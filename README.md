# ProjectUFEW
Project U.F.E.W. or Using Flask Easy Webservice is a standard webservice who connects with MariaDB (or MySQL) easily using Project Amelia Data Access.  


# === HOW TO USE ===

I highly recommend using some linux dist. for it.

- Install Python 3 or higher
- Install Python 3 Mysql Connector
- Install Flask
- Create a directory for the files
- I recommend this link for some questions > [Visual Studio and Flask](code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask) 
- Configure your config.cnf for your database - Don't forget to open the correct ports for it
- `python3 app.py` (if everything is ok, a message will come with local IP and port)

Now it's ready to go, have fun.

(I use and recommend procedural sql use for safety, but Amelia is gentle, so, open the file and discover another options)

<s>I hope you know what a webservice is</s>
