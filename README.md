# ProjectUFEW
Project U.F.E.W. or Using Flask Easy Webservice is a standard webservice who connects with MariaDB (or MySQL) easily using Project Amelia Data Access.  


===================== HOW TO USE ========================

I highly recommend using some linux dist. for it.

1 - Install Python 3 or higher
2 - Install Flask
3 - Create a directory for the files
- I recommend this link for some questions > code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask - 
4 - configure your config.cnf for your database - Don't forget to open the correct ports for it
5 - # python3 app.py (if everything is ok, a message will come with local IP and port)

Now it's ready to go, have fun.

(I use and recommend procedural sql use for safety)
